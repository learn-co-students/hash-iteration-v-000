#We are yeilding the key/value pair to the block of code between the do/end
#keywords by assigning the variables in between the pipes to be
#the placeholders for each key/value pair.

#yeild in this case.
#the each method iterates thru the hash and this #each method also has a yield
#statement. The yeild statement uses placeholder variables to pass the hash
#key/value pair it is currently iterating on to the specific code to be executed
#in the block. The block executes, then returns to the each method to begin the
#next iteration.
